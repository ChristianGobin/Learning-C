<dl>
    <dt>Hacker Rank Greatest of 4 inputs.</dt>
    <dd>
       Create a program that takes 4 given integer arguments and returns the largest to the user.

    <dt>Hacker Rank Sum and Differences using Scanf</dt>
    <dd>
        Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum.
        <ol>
            <li>Declare  variables: two of type int and two of type float.</li>
            <li>Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your  variables.</li>
            <li>
                Use the  and  operator to perform the following operations:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.</li>
                    <li>Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        Pointers in C
    </dt>
    <dd>
        In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C. A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable that it does not own.
